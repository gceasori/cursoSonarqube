Execute the Scanner for Gradle from your computer
Running an analysis with Gradle is straighforward. You just need to declare the org.sonarqube plugin in your build.gradle file:

plugins {
  id "org.sonarqube" version "2.7"
}
and run the following command:

./gradlew sonarqube \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=OnJava8 \
  -Dsonar.host.url=https://ec66dec155ab496692ae84e9ba1ad058.vfs.cloud9.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com \
  -Dsonar.login=73f5692f6825363a6982ade0971d39265ed19fba
Please visit the official documentation of the Scanner for Gradle for more details.

Once the analysis is completed, this page will automatically refresh and you will be able to browse the analysis results.
